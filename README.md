# 🤖 RANDER.AI

**AI-powered Error & Bug Fixing Platform**

RANDER.AI is an intelligent LLM-based platform designed to automatically detect, analyze, and fix bugs and errors in software applications and digital products.

We help teams reduce debugging time, lower development costs, and focus on building meaningful solutions instead of chasing errors.

## 🚀 What is RANDER.AI?

Modern applications are complex, and errors are inevitable. Traditional debugging methods are manual, slow, and resource-heavy.

RANDER.AI solves this by using advanced AI models that understand code context, error patterns, and system behavior to provide accurate and reliable fixes with minimal human intervention.
